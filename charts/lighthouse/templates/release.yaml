      chore: ensure opentelemetry annotations are not copied

      when copying lhjob annotations to other resources, we need to ensure that some of them won't be copied:
      the annotations holding the opentelemetry trace context

      these are used by https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse-telemetry-plugin to propagate the trace context between different resources
      (lhjob, pipelinerun, pipelinetask, pod, activity, ...) and should be unique for each resource
